The null hypothesis is the statement that we want to test, while the alternative hypothesis is the statement that we accept if we reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "* Student's t-distribution, also known as the t-distribution, is a probability distribution that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population with an unknown variance. It is used to make inferences about the population mean based on a sample of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The t-distribution has a bell-shaped curve, like the normal distribution, but with heavier tails. This means that it has more probability in the tails than the normal distribution. The shape of the t-distribution depends on a parameter called degrees of freedom (df), which is determined by the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small. Specifically, when the sample size is less than 30 or the population variance is unknown, the t-distribution is used instead of the normal distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a given sample mean. In these situations, the t-distribution provides a better approximation of the true sampling distribution of the mean.\n",
